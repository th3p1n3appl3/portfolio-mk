# portfolio-mk

## Description

This project was my first attempt at making and designing a website from scratch. I have also come realise during this project that, while I am aspiring to become a web-developer, I definitely will want to have nothing to do with web-design. My design limitations made me seek out help on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU) as I have found the provided design in the mock-up unappealing. Sadly due to time constraints, I was not able to fully recreate the design, but learnt how to make a function in JS for my navigation button which also smoothly transitions into mobile design. The website is not fully responsive as, again, media queries became a lengthy endeavour to write and I ran out of time.

Here is the link to the deployed application: https://th3p1n3appl3.github.io/portfolio-mk/

## Installation

You may download the code or clone this repository and afterwards deploy it on a web service of your choice.

## Usage

The main usage of this project is to have made a portfolio project from scratch exclusively HTML/CSS/JS and learning how painful that can be. Frameworks such as Bootstrap would have significantly improved the development process and made it easier in addition. This project or components may be reused for another, more sophisticated portfolio website.
